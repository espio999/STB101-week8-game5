```{r setup}
library(readxl)
Book5 <- read_excel("Book5.xlsx", range = "j11:k15")

x = c(Book5$Data)
y = c(Book5$Propotion)
```

## Can we assert that responded students represent the population ( research object )?
### assumption
H0: no difference in distribution between 
+ observed frequency (responded students)
+ expected frequency (proportion for each grade).  
H1: not H0

```{r}
chisq.test(x, p=y)
```
P is greater than 5%.  
H0 is not rejected.

### conclusion
Responded students represent the population.
